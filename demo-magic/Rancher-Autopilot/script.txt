hello,

Today I will be demoing Autopilot.

Autopilot is a Portworx feature that provides automatic capacity managment for persistent volumes.

Autopilot uses rules to detect when a persistent volume reaches a capacity threshold, and performs an action, such as automaticaly
growing the volume.

Autopilot can also manage portworx storage pools to automatically increase back-end capacity.

This allows administrators to save money by right sizing persistent volumes, as well as right sizing storage pools, all while providing 
peace of mind that when a volume runs low on space, it will be remediated without any intervention on the part of the administrator.

Let's get started.
