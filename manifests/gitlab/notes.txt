The following charts are included for evaluation purposes only. They will not be supported by GitLab Support
for production workloads. Use Cloud Native Hybrid deployments for production. For more information visit
https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/index.html#use-the-reference-architectures.
- PostgreSQL

=== NOTICE
The minimum required version of PostgreSQL is now 14. See https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/upgrade.html for more details.

=== NOTICE
You've installed GitLab Runner without the ability to use 'docker in docker'.
The GitLab Runner chart (gitlab/gitlab-runner) is deployed without the `privileged` flag by default for security purposes. This can be changed by setting `gitlab-runner.runners.privileged` to `true`. Before doing so, please read the GitLab Runner chart's documentation on why we
chose not to enable this by default. See https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes.html#running-docker-in-docker-containers-with-gitlab-runners
