Hello,

Today I am going to demo Async DR using two rancher clusters. 

Async DR uses an object store to transfer data between to clusters. 
It will ensure that all of our PVCs and manifests are present on the destination cluster 
  so that we can activate our application by simply scaling the destination cluster resources

Let's get started.

I have two rancher clusters that have already been paired and are ready for DR.

Let's take a few moments to talk about the cluster pair object.

The clusterpair object (named demo in this case) contains connection information about the destination cluster. 
such as:
- portworx endpoint
- cluster control plane
- authentication information


next, let's take a look at the migrationSchedule manifest. 

This manifest contains information about what we want to replicate and the schedule interval.
Keep in mind that we can apply more granular selectors by using labels, although we haven't done that here.

We are now going to watch for the next scheduled migration. I will speed up the video.

pause - get destination PX BBQ ready in the background.

Now we will simulate a DR event by halting the nodes in the source cluster. 

Switching to our destination cluster, I'm going to activate the pxbbq application. 
We don't need storkctl to do this, we can also just scale the deployments and stateful sets

With our failover complete, let's make sure our application still has our order.
