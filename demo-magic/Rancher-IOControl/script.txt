Hello,

In this demo I'm going to show you a feature of Portworx Enterprise called Application IO Control.

Application IO Control allows us to put limits on IOs and Bandwidth of our volumes by configuring paramaters on a storageclass, or by 
setting a limit on existing volumes.

This ensures that volumes cannot cause cluster wide performance problems by over-utilizing IO, which is sometimes called
a "Noisy Neighbor"

Let's get started



---

I will be running this demo on a rancher RKE 2 cluster in my lab, and using grafana to meter the load.

To generate IO load, I will be using kubstr, which is a container that runs a synthentic workload using fio inside a container

While we wait for that to spool up, let's look at an example storage class. Application IO control can throttle IOPS and Bandwidth, but not both for the same operation.
For example, I cannot limit the IOPS and Bandwidth of read operations.

Switching to our Portworx provided grafana dashboard, we can see that our IOPS are very high.

of course a storageClass is a great place to apply IO controls by policy, but sometimes we just want to limit the IO of a particular application after it has been provisioned

I'm going to do that to our kubestr pvc now by setting a limit on read and write IOPS to 750.

And after checking grafana, we can indeed see that our IO has been reduced drastically.

Thanks for watching.
