### Bridge netwoking configuration

For this config I am starting on my gentoo box, which might be a bad idea

This seems to be a helpful article:

gentoo configuration for open-rc uses netifrc: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Netifrc

I added the config to create a bridge using the above. dhcpcd still gets an andress on eno1, which I'm not sure about.
